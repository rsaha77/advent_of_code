# 🎄 Advent of Code 2022 – Archived Solutions

This repository contains **some of the problems I solved** from Advent of Code 2022.  

> ⚠️ Note: I have **lost the remaining solutions**, so this repo is being kept mainly for **archival purposes**.

## 📌 About
- Contains partial solutions and rough work from AoC 2022.  
- Only a subset of all problems solved are present.  
- Useful for reference or inspiration, but **not a complete collection**.  

---

## 📝 Highlights
- Solutions include a mix of **brute force, BFS, DFS, DP**, and other techniques.  
- Some code may be messy or unoptimized, as this was more of a **personal log** than a polished repo.

## 🔹 Contact / Connect
- Open to discussions about problem-solving approaches, optimizations, or insights from AoC 2022.
