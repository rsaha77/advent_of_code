# ðŸ§© 2024 Advent of Code â€“ My Notes

A brief log of my thought process while solving some of Advent of Code 2024 problems.

---

## **Day 18**
- Initially approached with **Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm**.  
- Later switched to **BFS + Binary Search** to optimize.  

---

## **Day 19**
- **Part 1:** Solved easily (True/False based), overlapping issues werenâ€™t a problem.  
- **Part 2:** Struggled due to a **wrong approach**. Realized itâ€™s a typical DP-style problem; likely seen in LeetCode before.

---

## **Day 20**
- **Part 1:** Easy â€” brute force using BFS worked.  
- **Part 2:** Brute force BFS calls too slow. Modified solution to call BFS **only once**, but still didnâ€™t work.  
- **Realization:** Understood the correct approach on **Day 21**.
